He adds: “This is indeed a very sad day for the Sephaku family. Pieter was pivotal in negotiating the relationship agreement with Dangote Industries plc to establish SepHold’s partnership in Sephaku Cement. “Pieter had successfully established SepCem as a formidable cement brand in South Africa at the time of his passing. “He will be sorely missed and will remain an indelible part of the company story of success.”
