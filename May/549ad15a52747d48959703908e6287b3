On May 5, 2021, Moneyweb published a story regarding Daybreak Farms’s joint venture with Hestony Transport. The story referred to a forensic investigation, at the behest of Daybreak’s board, which probed allegations of wrongdoing at this joint venture. The story was largely based on the forensic report resulting from this investigation. Moneyweb, however, also had access to unverified supporting documents. In also using some of these supporting documents as a basis for the story, Moneyweb erroneously reported that several companies – Xspan Logistics, Muhari Logistics Fairland Longhaul and Willowton Logistics – which supplied the joint venture should be investigated for criminal activity. This should not have been done as it was not a conclusion of the report. Moneyweb unreservedly apologises to these companies for implying that they were involved in dishonesty and criminal activity.
