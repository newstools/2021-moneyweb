British Prime Minister Boris Johnson married his fiancee Carrie Symonds in a secret ceremony in Westminster Cathedral on Saturday.
A Downing Street spokesman confirmed the news Sunday morning. “The Prime Minister and Ms Symonds were married yesterday afternoon in a small ceremony,” he said. “The couple will celebrate their wedding with family and friends next summer.” Last April, Johnson, 56, announced the birth of his son with Symonds, 33. They were the first unmarried couple officially to live together in Downing Street. Johnson, who has been married twice before, is the first prime minister to wed in office in 199 years, the Sunday Times said. © 2021 Bloomberg Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.
