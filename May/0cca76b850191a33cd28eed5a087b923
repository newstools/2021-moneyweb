The airline exited administration in late April after receiving R7.8 billion from the government, but at the time it did not say when it would take to the skies again. “As a draft or as a proposal we are looking at July-August 2021,” SAA’s chief executive Thomas Kgokolo said during a presentation to a parliamentary committee. “However these dates come with some complexities, the issue of the Covid-19 is something that we still need to consider … and there is a complex matter that we are dealing with of pilots as well,” he added.

The airline has been trying to reach a settlement with the pilots for months. SAA is one of a handful of South African state companies reliant on government bailouts, placing the country’s budget under strain at a time of rapidly rising debt.
