The “step aside” rule is an important test of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s control over the ANC and his commitment to tackle graft. One of Ramaphosa’s most prominent party rivals, Secretary-General Ace Magashule, faces corruption charges but has refused to vacate his position in charge of the day-to-day running of the party that has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid. The NWC comprises top ANC officials and implements the decisions of the party’s executive.

A decision by a member to voluntarily “step aside” from their post would be reviewed by the party every six months, it added.
