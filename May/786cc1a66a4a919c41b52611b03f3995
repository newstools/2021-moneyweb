The SARB said it would “investigate the feasibility, desirability and appropriateness of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as electronic legal tender, for general-purpose retail use, complementary to cash.” The objective of the study is to consider how the issuance of a general-purpose CBDC would feed into the Sarb’s policy position and mandate, it said.
