South Africa’s cash-strapped state companies may struggle to refinance their debts, requiring the government to provide support, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said.

Those include power utility Eskom, which has 401 billion rand in liabilities and has already received several bail-outs.

All the nation’s obligations will be met, and the short-term and foreign debt risk levels are below that of similarly rated peer countries and within its risk benchmarks, Mboweni said. © 2021 Bloomberg
