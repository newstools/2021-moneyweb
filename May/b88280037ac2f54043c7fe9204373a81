ImmunityBio Inc.’s hAd5 T-cell Covid-19 vaccine candidate is being considered as a booster shot in a study of almost 500 000 South African health workers who have received Johnson & Johnson’s inoculation.

That could make it more effective against strains such as the one first found in South Africa in late 2020, ImmunityBio said in a statement earlier this year. ImmunityBio’s vaccine is in phase one trials in Cape Town, and the company has signed an agreement with South Africa’s BioVac Institute to produce the inoculation in the country should it win approval. A broader rollout of Covid-19 vaccines began in South Africa this week.
