It began wage talks with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and Solidarity early this month. NUM demanded a salary increase of 15% in the 2021/22 financial year but would also consider a multi-year agreement, while NUMSA wants a one-year 15% salary increase and Solidarity is seeking a 9.5% annual increase over multiple years.

Eskom said in a statement that its wage offer was conditional on labour representatives accepting amendments to staff conditions of employment including overtime rates and travel time. Negotiations are ongoing. The utility, which is choking under more than R460 billion ($32 billion) of debt, imposes regular power cuts as it grapples with repeated faults at its ailing coal-fired power stations.
