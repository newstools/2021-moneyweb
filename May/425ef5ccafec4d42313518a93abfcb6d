The executive’s exit comes after employees of the Isibaya Fund, which includes the department Rajdhar ran, accused some of the money manager’s senior leaders of causing an “existential crisis” by allowing a mandate with its biggest client to expire. The 2016 agreement with the Government Employees Pension Fund enabled the fund to make unlisted investments. The employees wrote a nine-page letter to the company’s investment committee detailing their complaints, which included allegations of poor management. Rajdhar was not a subject of the complaints. A judicial inquiry last year found that the PIC’s management flouted internal procedures and made questionable investment decisions over many years. The money manager oversees R1.9 trillion ($139 billion) of assets, which mainly comprises civil servants’ pensions.
