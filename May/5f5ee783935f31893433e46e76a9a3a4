The rand’s rise follows the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) maintaining the repo rate at 3.5% but having a “hawkish tone” noted Nedbank in its weekly economic monitor. In recent times the rand has not only strengthened against the dollar, said Nedbank; over the week to end May 21, it rose 0.9% against the euro and 0.8% against the pound. The bank pointed out that this has been a trend for a while. “Over the past four weeks and on a year-to-date basis, the rand has reaped reasonable gains against all the above currencies.”
