Housing and utilities increased by 2.3% year on year, and contributed 0.6 of a percentage point. Transport increased by 10.6% year on year, and contributed 1.5 percentage points. Miscellaneous goods and services increased by 4% year on year, and contributed 0.7 of a percentage point. The annual inflation rates for goods and for services were 6.4% and 2.7% respectively.
