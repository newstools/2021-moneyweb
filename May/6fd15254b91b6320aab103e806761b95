The ANC said in a statement that the decision to oppose Magashule’s application was agreed at a meeting of its top officials on Monday. Magashule, a leading political rival of President Cyril Ramaphosa, was temporarily relieved of his duties in charge of the day-to-day running of the ANC early this month in line with tougher rules for members charged with corruption. He faces corruption charges over a contract to audit homes with asbestos roofs when he was premier of Free State province but has called the charges flimsy. Magashule was granted bail in November. Ramaphosa has staked his reputation on cleaning up the ANC’s image, and the move to sideline Magashule is seen as an attempt to stamp his authority on the party before a leadership contest next year at which he is expected to seek re-election.
