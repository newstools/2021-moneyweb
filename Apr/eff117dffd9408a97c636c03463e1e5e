Eskom is implementing Stage 2 loadshedding from 21:00 tonight (Tuesday) until 05:00 on Wednesday morning, due to a shortage of generation capacity. “The return to service of three generation units has been delayed, while another three generation units tripped during the day, reducing available generation capacity. This loadshedding is also necessary in order to manage and preserve the emergency generation reserves,” it said in a statement in the early evening. “A generation unit each at the Tutuka and Kendal power stations tripped while a single Komati unit was forced down. The return to service of a generation unit each at the Kriel, Medupi and the Duvha power stations has been delayed.” The utility says it has 4 775MW on planned maintenance, with another 12 699MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays. The possibility of loadshedding remains elevated, as Eskom continues to implement reliability maintenance.
