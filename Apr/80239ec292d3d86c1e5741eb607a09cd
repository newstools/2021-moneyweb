The move underscores the legal complications following the container vessel’s grounding on March 23, which led to the canal being closed for almost a week and roiled shipping markets. Logjams are expected to continue in the coming weeks at major ports such as Singapore and Rotterdam because of disruptions to schedules, according to supply-chain data provider project44. The SCA has said compensation is needed to cover losses linked to transit fees, damage to the waterway during the dredging and salvage efforts, and the cost of equipment and labor. It has calculated that losses of revenue amounted to about $15 million a day. Calls placed to the SCA weren’t answered. A spokesman for the Ever Given’s owner, Japan-based Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd., declined to comment on compensation while discussions with the SCA are underway. The company said the crew is still on board the ship, which is now in the Great Bitter Lake, about halfway along the canal.
