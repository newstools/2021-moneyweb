Utime, also based in China, surged 875% two weeks ago while Las Vegas-based Esports Technologies, which focuses on customers in Asia and Latin America, popped 507% in its first day of trading last week. The recent success of tiny listings contrasts with headaches among some larger debuts this month. But not every small listing is a winner. Another debut under $25 million on Tuesday, Los Angeles-based Troika Media Group, fell below its IPO price. WestPark Capital underwrote Infobird’s listing. © 2021 Bloomberg
