Apple said its iOS 14.5 software update will roll out next week, introducing changes to ad tracking that will upend digital marketing and roil the business models of Facebook and other developers. The company made the disclosure as part of the release of new iPad Pros and other products on Tuesday. The controversial change in iOS 14.5 requires users to opt-in to tracking for personalised advertising. Developers expect to lose revenue because most consumers wonâ€™t bother to opt in. Apple has said users should decide how their data is used. The iOS 14.5 update also lets users unlock their iPhones with Face ID while using a mask by leveraging a worn Apple Watch as an added layer of authentication. Other updates included new voices in Siri, a refreshed Podcast app, additional emojis and enhancements to the Maps app. Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.
