MTN South Africa has taken the axe to prepaid data prices, reducing the cost of 10GB of data (including another 10GB for use at certain times of the night) to R149. The new MTN BozzaGigs LTE tariff plan also offers 10GB (5GB plus 5GB night-time data) for R99 and comes a week after Vodacom cut headline prepaid data prices, with 1GB of data falling to R85 from R99 previously.
