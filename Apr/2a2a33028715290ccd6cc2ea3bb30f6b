India and South Africa have offered a proposal that seeks a broad waiver from the WTO’s rules on the production and export of vaccines and other critical medical goods needed to combat the Covid-19 virus. The waiver would enable poorer nations without the means to develop vaccines and other medical technologies to do everything they can to treat their citizens without fear of punitive trade retaliation. As of Thursday, 40% of the Covid-19 vaccines administered globally have gone to people in 27 wealthy nations that represent 11% of the global population. Countries making up the least-wealthy 11% have gotten just 1.6% of Covid-19 vaccines administered so far, according to an analysis of data collected by the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. © 2021 Bloomberg
