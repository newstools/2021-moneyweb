South Africa, the continent’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter, gets most of its power from coal-fired power stations. Nedbank, one of the country’s four biggest banks lenders, has made the strongest commitments so far to curb its lending to the coal, oil, and gas sectors. “Nedbank’s energy policy serves to guide the bank’s transition away from fossil fuels while still providing appropriate support to existing energy requirements,” said Nedbank chief financial officer Mike Davis. Nedbank also said it aimed to finance local small-scale renewable power generation to the tune of R2 billion ($141 million) above its R50 billion commitment to the country’s renewable energy tendering process.
