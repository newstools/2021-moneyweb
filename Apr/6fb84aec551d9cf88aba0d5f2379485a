By then it had already paid for 1.5 million doses of the vaccine from the Serum Institute and taken delivery of the first 1 million. It pivoted to administering Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine in a research study targeting up to 500 000 healthcare workers, and sold the 1 million AstraZeneca doses to other African countries. “The funds are in our bank account. This therefore closes the matter,” Mkhize said. He added that J&J – whose vaccine was approved for use in South Africa last week – had confirmed that it would supply around 1.1 million doses this month. The government also expects to receive a first batch of the two-dose Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine this month, he said. Between the J&J and Pfizer deals, South Africa has secured the supply of 51 million doses, enough to vaccinate roughly two-thirds of its 60 million people. Mkhize said it aimed to inoculate up to 270 000 people a day at the peak of its campaign, in order to reach broad population immunity within a year.
