African nations plan to raise about $8 billion for a fund to help offset revenue losses for countries that lower cross-border tariffs, as part of a continent-wide free-trade agreement.

The world’s biggest free-trade area aims to bolster intra-African trade by lowering or eliminating cross-border tariffs on 90% of goods, facilitating the movement of capital and people, promoting investment and paving the way for a customs union. Trade within the continent, which stands at more than $350 billion a year, is expected to grow by 52% in the next decade, according to David Luke, coordinator of the African Trade Policy Centre at the United Nation’s Economic Commission for Africa.
