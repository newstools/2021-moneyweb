It is reviewing the cause and contributing factors of all recent derailments. “There are serious risks in a recovery system based on emergency procurement, which may be open to abuse not only internally, but by suppliers who benefit from such incidents occurring,” the company said. Transnet plans to reduce dependency on outside contractors and require the certification of those who continue to provide services. “Not only must our partners be suitably qualified, they must be contractually accountable,” Transnet said. Many of South Africa’s state-owned companies face financial struggles, having been weighed down by corruption and mismanagement. Transnet and power utility Eskom are integral to the economy and require fundamental changes in order to succeed.
