Read: Zuma asks court to cancel 15-month jail sentence Zuma’s application will be heard on July 12, Dunisani Mathiba, the court’s acting registrar, said in a court filing on Saturday. Its decision will probably mean that Zuma will no longer have to surrender himself by Sunday as scheduled, although the court didn’t issue specific instructions in that regard.
