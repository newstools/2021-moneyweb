Stories abound of South Africans being hit with 40% tax on their UK and US portfolios. “It’s a situation that is entirely avoidable if you do the right planning,” says Pierre Cloete, CEO of specialist offshore advisor International Wealth & Prosperity (IWP). “The benefits of offshore investing may be well known, but what is less understood are the pitfalls of investing offshore when the investor passes away. Bad planning can dramatically reduce the distributable benefit to the beneficiaries named in the will.” This assumes there is a will that covers all eventualities. Here are some of the hazards of offshore investing that can arise in the event that the investor passes away: “Investing offshore, particularly in low-cost passive funds, has become the most acceptable way for South Africans to diversify their portfolios and protect their wealth,” says Cloete. “Any responsible investor should be taking maximum advantage of the opportunities abroad. For example, the S&P 500 index outpaced the JSE Top 40 by a factor of 10 to one over the last decade. “That said, there are quite a few pitfalls that have to be negotiated with offshore assets, to avoid the kind of unnecessary taxes and delays that can result from poor planning.” To see how International Wealth & Prosperity (IWP) can assist you in building your global wealth, go to iwpsa.com.
