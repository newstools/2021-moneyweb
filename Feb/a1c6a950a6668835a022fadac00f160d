Bezos’s fortune has almost doubled since he topped the $100 billion mark in late 2017, even after ceding a quarter of his Amazon stake to ex-wife MacKenzie Scott in a divorce in 2019. Last February, he committed $10 billion to issues related to climate change and in November announced the first of those grants, totaling nearly $800 million to 16 groups. He also disclosed another round of grants for his Day One Fund, giving away more than $100 million to 42 organisations that combat family homelessness. Bezos, 57, who’ll continue as Amazon’s executive chairman, said in an email to employees that he intends to spend more time on philanthropy and his other companies, including Blue Origin and the Washington Post. “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring,” he wrote.
