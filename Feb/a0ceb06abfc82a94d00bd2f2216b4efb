Home market sales, which account for over three quarters of the company’s total sales, grew by 5.6% for the half year, said Shoprite, the country’s largest retailer by market capitalisation. The biggest sales driver was Shoprite’s furniture business, comprising OK Furniture and House & Home, where sales increased by 15.7% from the year ago period. South African retailers, suffering even before the coronavirus had hit the country, got a fresh lease of life last year when consumers showed a renewed interest in furniture and home ware products as people started spending more time at home. Shoprite did not say if the trend was sustainable. Sales from Checkers and Checkers Hyper – Shoprite’s retail outlets aimed at bigger cities – reported sales growth of 11.1%., the company said. Shoprite will announce first-half results on March 16.
