Ghana plans to procure 17.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine by the end of June with the first doses arriving in March, President Nana Akufo-Addo said on Sunday.

So far it has recorded over 63 000 cases and 416 deaths. “Our aim is to vaccinate the entire population, with an initial target of twenty million people,” Akufo-Addo said in a speech to the West African nation of around 30 million.
