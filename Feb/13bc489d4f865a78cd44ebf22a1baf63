MTN has been selling assets to streamline the company and pay down debt, and has a target of raising R25 billion over the next three-to-five years. The carrier exited stakes in the Ghana and Uganda tower assets last year, and has also offloaded a minority interest in e-commerce group Jumia Technologies AG. Next up may be the sale-and-leaseback of the company’s South African towers, according to people familiar with the matter. The earnings gain takes into account impairments related to units in Syria and Yemen, which are also up for sale, as well as Liberia and Guinea-Bissau. Headline earnings per share, which exclude one-time items, are expected to have risen by as much as 70%. MTN shares pared gains to trade 4.5% higher to R69.11 as of 2:31 p.m. in Johannesburg, or 16% in the year to date.
