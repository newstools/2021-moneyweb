Core inflation, which excludes prices of food, non-alcoholic beverages, fuel and energy, was at 3.3% year-on-year in January, the same as in December. On a month-on-month basis core inflation fell to 0.1% from 0.2% previously. Nedbank’s Group Economic Unit  said consumer inflation rose, albeit marginally, for the first time since October last year. “Inflation is expected to edge higher in the months ahead, with some upward pressure coming from higher fuel prices and electricity tariffs, but there will be contained by subdued domestic demand and a stronger rand,” it added. “The bulk of the upward drift will reflect the effect of last year’s extremely low base. On balance inflation is likely to remain well contained. “As a result, we believe the Reserve Bank (Sarb) will keep interest rates unchanged at the current levels for the remainder of this year.” PwC also believes it’s unlikely that Sarb will raise interest rate in the short term. “On a further positive note, Sarb Governor Lesetja Kganyago, said early in February that the central bank has scope to respond with further support should a third wave of Covid-19 infections hit South Africa this year – a third wave is part of our baseline expectations for the economy this year,” PwC said.
