Tesla will recall about 135 000 Model S and X vehicles in the US after a months-long investigation by the nationâ€™s auto-safety regulator concluded their touch screens are defective.

Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sent a letter to Tesla saying it had determined the failures constituted a defect. While the company disagrees with the finding, it will voluntarily initiate a recall and replace memory devices within the processors. NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into the issue in June and upgraded the probe to an engineering analysis in November. The agency had asked Tesla to respond to its defect finding no later than January 27, the day the electric-car maker reported quarterly earnings. Its recall report is dated January 29.
