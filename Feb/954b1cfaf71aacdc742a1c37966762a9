The local currency added to gains from the previous session, where it briefly dipped below the R15.00 level seen as a target for rand bulls and importers. The rand’s attractive yield, or carry, compared to other emerging market currencies, continued to shield it from being negatively affected by signs of a weak local economy. Factory activity data on Monday showed demand remained tepid in the continent’s largest economy, while new car sales figures contracted again, falling 13.9% in January. Sentiment was boosted by arrival of South Africa’s first batch of Covid-19 vaccines, one million doses of the AstraZeneca shot. In a speech during which he lifted some coronavirus lockdown restrictions, President Cyril Ramaphosa said the country had secured almost enough doses to vaccinate its target of 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population.
