The rare revelation by one of China’s most prominent private firms underscores Beijing’s increasingly tough stance on corruption among government cadres and corporate executives. More than 1.5 million government officials alone have been punished in a years-long campaign prioritised by Chinese President Xi Jinping.

It outlined alleged infractions from influence-peddling and accepting kickbacks from suppliers to bribery.
