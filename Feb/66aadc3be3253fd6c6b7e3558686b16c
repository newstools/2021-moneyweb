The owner of popular brands Jungle Oats and Tastic rice said headline earnings per share (HEPS), the main profit measure in South Africa, is expected to be between 10% and 20% higher in the period, the firm’s first half, compared with 611 cents reported in the same period last year. Including its now sold value-added meat products business, HEPS is seen rising as much as 45%.
