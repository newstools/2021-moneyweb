Tencent, the owner of the WeChat super-app used by more than a billion people, said earlier this month it fired more than 100 employees on suspicion of graft over a series of investigations over the past year and reported more than 40 workers to police.

Tencent didn’t immediately have a comment on the report. © 2021 Bloomberg
