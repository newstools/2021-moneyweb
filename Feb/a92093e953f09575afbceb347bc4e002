The utility added that two other units which were offline had also been returned to serviced. State-owned Eskom regularly implements outages in Africa’s most industrialised nation because of faults at its coal-fired power stations, constraining economic growth. Of Eskom’s total nominal capacity of about 44,000 MW, more than 4,664 MW is offline for planned maintenance and another 13,539 MW is unavailable owing to breakdowns, it said. It said the power system remained vulnerable and unpredictable.
