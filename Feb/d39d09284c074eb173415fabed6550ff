The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) said at a virtual meeting of a parliamentary committee that the remainder of a R10.5 billion  ($702.4 million) bailout could flow to the airline now an appropriation act had been passed. So far R2.8 billion of the bailout has been transferred to SAA, the department’s presentation showed. “We are expecting that during the course of this month the business rescue practitioners should be exiting the business,” DPE Director-General Kgathatso Tlhakudi said. “We have agreed to set up a receivership to take care of the remaining liabilities,” he added.

It added that it had received expressions of interest from potential partners in SAA Group and its subsidiaries.
