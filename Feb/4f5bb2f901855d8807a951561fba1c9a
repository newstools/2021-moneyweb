The plan to list Universal represents part of a process launched by Vivendi’s top shareholder, French billionaire Vincent Bollore, to cash in on the music industry’s revival. Vivendi said over the weekend that the UMG capital distribution would take the form of a special dividend, while UMG, a holding company being incorporated in the Netherlands, would also apply for a stock market listing in Amsterdam. It said the transaction has been supported by a consortium led by Chinese tech group Tencent, which now controls 20% of UMG, having bought the stake in two moves that valued UMG at 30 billion euros ($36.4 billion).
