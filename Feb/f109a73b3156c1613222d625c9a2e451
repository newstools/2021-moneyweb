Eskom is implementing Stage 2 loadshedding from 22:00 tonight (Tuesday) until 5am on Wednesday, “to preserve and replenish the emergency generation reserves and to maximise the capacity available during the daytime hours”. It said the power generation system is still severely constrained due to high generation unit breakdowns during the past two days and the the delayed return to service of some units out on planned maintenance. “We currently have 4 858MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 375MW of capacity is unavailable due to breakdowns and delays. Eskom expects some of these generation units to return to service from tomorrow, and will continuously assess the situation.” The utility said it continues to implement reliability maintenance and as such the system will continue to be constrained, with the risk of loadshedding remaining elevated.
