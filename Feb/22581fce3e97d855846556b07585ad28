So you need a business loan? If you’re battling to find the right one, you are not alone. In South Africa, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can choose from hundreds of funders offering a mind-numbing array of options. You might think all that choice makes getting a business loan easy. But in truth, SMEs are struggling to access finance – and a big part of the problem is getting the right information. Brought to you by Ecommerce.co.za, this webinar will unpack the most common questions around applying for business funding as well as the key assessment criteria funders look at. Moneyweb’s Ciaran Ryan will be chatting to Tom Stuart of Lulalend and Simon Purdon from the FundingHub on Wednesday, March 10 at 11am. To register for this webinar, click here.
