The outsourcing of the fund’s administration is to comply with a 2017 decision by Botswana’s regulators that all pension funds be managed by an independent administrator unconnected with the fund itself. The BPOF, one of Africa’s largest pension funds and the dominant investor in the diamond producer’s economy with stakes in energy, mining and retail, has been anxious to fall in line with financial regulations and streamline its administration after ending an outsourcing deal with Alexander Forbes in 2015. Botswana’s financial industry has been growing in recent years to become a key driver of growth in the services sector, but the industry is still dominated by South African firms.
