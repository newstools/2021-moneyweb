With coronavirus variants sweeping the globe, the World Health Organisation has devised a less technical way of describing them than their scientific, number-heavy names — using the Greek alphabet. Deploying letters like Alpha, Beta and Gamma — instead of B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 — to refer to the variants will make it “easier and more practical” to discuss them with non-scientific audiences, the WHO said in a statement. The organisation convened a group of scientists to consider easy-to-pronounce and non-stigmatising labels for the virus strains, which it divides into categories as “of interest” and “of concern.” Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.
