Travel agency Flight Centre Travel Group is advising its customers not to book on South African Airways (SAA) or Mango Airlines because of various limitations the airlines have put on their booking platforms. SAA, for instance, is only showing flights for bookings in specific classes, while Mango is only showing flights two to three days ahead.

At the time of writing, tickets simply read as ‘sold out’ beyond June 20 on the system. Meanwhile SAA, on its website, is reporting a suspension of all domestic and regional flights until July 31 this year and a suspension of international flights until October 30. Despite speculations that Mango was set to halt operations from May 1 following its outstanding debt to Airports Company South Africa (Acsa), the airline managed to continue and operate scheduled flights. However, it is still unclear how much longer the airline will stay in the air. Mango has not provided any further comment to Moneyweb.
