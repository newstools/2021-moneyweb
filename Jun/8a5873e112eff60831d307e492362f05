These are expected in the country by end of month. Furthermore 500 000 doses of vaccines are expected to be delivered this Saturday,” Monica Mutsvangwa said during a post-Cabinet media briefing. Zimbabwe has only authorised China’s Sinovac and Sinopharm, Russia’s Sputnik V and India’s Covaxin doses for emergency use. Mutsvangwa said reopening of schools, which was set for June 28, would be delayed by two weeks after weekly infections doubled from last week. Zimbabwe has reported 42 195 cases and 1 685 deaths since the outbreak last year. Some 704 000 people, out of a target of 10 million, have received a first shot of a Covid-19 vaccine.
