A while ago, I wrote ‘How to fix the JSE’ where I highlighted what problems the JSE is facing and I offered a range of solutions. One of these solutions was to offer the South African equivalent of an ‘American Depository Receipt’ (ADR) and list single stocks of major offshore groups on the JSE (in other words, a Joburg Depository Receipt or a ‘JDR’). While this is not quite what has happened (it still might happen, legislative willing!), FNB has quietly launched a single-stock exchange-traded note (ETN) on the JSE. You can find the entire list and their respective pricing supplements here under the ‘Exchange-traded notes’ title. Let me explain these notes simply: The current list of individual stocks that FNB has issued these single-stock ETNs for are: Just a note about how the currency hedged ‘Q’ notes that cost 0.0% per annum to hold are in fact expensive: When you hedge a low interest currency into a high interest currency, you earn the interest rate differential. The US 10-year bond yield of 1.5% is materially lower than our domestic 10-year bond yield of 8.6%. Simplistically, you can borrow USDs at 1.5% and park those USDs into a 8.6% yielding ZAR investment, earning a ‘free’ 7.1% return (ignoring transaction costs and other realities). FNB is effectively pocketing this interest rate differential through hedging the ‘Q’ notes. Thus, FNB need not charge a management fee here as the net interest differential on this hedge is likely larger than the ‘C’ notes 1% pa management fee! Finally, while these ETNs are nice and innovative, they are not quite the ‘JDRs’ I envisioned. ETNs have plenty of flaws that JDRs would not have. That said, well done to the FNB team for launching these and I look forward to many more stocks being covered (both by them and competing offerings!).
