The biggest labour group at South Africa’s Eskom Holdings accused the power utility of disregarding rules around wage negotiations by implementing its final offer to workers. Eskom will implement a 1.5% basic wage increase from July 1, funded through savings realised from reviewing employee benefits, according to the company. The utility declared a dispute with unions earlier this month and the deadlock is now being considered by the country’s Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration, for which it hasn’t reached a conclusion.

Eskom is taking that away.” Once the CCMA makes its findings they will be binding on all parties, Eskom spokesman Sikonathi Mantshantsha said in a reply to questions. “Any party dissatisfied with the process can take the matter on review at the Labour Court.” The loss-making utility that has subjected the country to intermittent outages for more than a decade, partly because of poor maintenance at its plants, is struggling under a debt pile of R401 billion ($28 billion). It considered wage increases of as much as 15% demanded by labour at the start of the negotiations as unaffordable.
