We know from blockchain research firm Glassnode that a high percentage of newcomers to bitcoin are currently underwater as a result of the May 2021 price crash. Bitcoin dropped 47% from its February peak to its May trough, which is by no means unusual, but what is a record was the $11 506 single-day drop in price on May 19. As the bitcoin volatility index chart below shows, the recent bull market was by no means exceptional in terms of volatility, which is still well below bitcoin’s 2013 and 2018 peaks, which were followed by dramatic price drops. However, there have also been occasions when the volatility index was above 4 (as in 2020) which had virtually no effect on the bull market just getting underway.

That price difference typically ranges between 2% and 5% and went momentarily to 15% in recent weeks. Harmse explains that there is a time lag on SA crypto exchanges as bitcoin prices drop. “Bitcoin is generally more expensive on SA exchanges than overseas ones, and we assist our clients to harvest that price difference without incurring too much risk.” After the price run-up in the early part of 2021, bitcoin failed to break decisively above $65 000. The price remained range-bound for several months, resulting in volatility falling. That changed in May 2021 when Elon Musk reversed an earlier decision to allow customers to purchase Tesla vehicles using bitcoin, and the Bank of China cautioned against the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. The bitcoin price promptly dropped 44% from its May peak, driving millions of bitcoin newcomers underwater. Those who took advantage of the arbitrage opportunities were able to not only protect their capital but increase their equity by 2-3% over the last three weeks, according to Harmse. Why arbitrage is the antidote to bitcoin volatility Harmse says arbitrage is the antidote to bitcoin volatility for the following reasons: About Coindirect Coindirect recently raised €1 million (R17 million) in a seed funding round led by Concentric, with participation from Blockchain.com and Andreessen Horowitz backed MakerDAO.
