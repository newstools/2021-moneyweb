It has mainly taken its cue from global factors, shrugging off poor local manufacturing data that showed the sector was still stuck in a rut in November. Comments by President Cyril Ramaphosa in an address to the nation on Monday that the country had secured more Covid-19 vaccines lifted the market’s mood temporarily, but details as to when the vaccines would arrive and who would supply them are still scarce. Next week, attention will turn to the South African Reserve Bank’s first monetary policy meeting of 2021. Most analysts polled by Reuters predict the bank will keep its main lending rate on hold at 3.5%, but a small minority have pencilled in a rate cut. Another cut could hurt the rand by making investing in local assets less attractive. Government bonds were broadly flat in early deals, with the yield on the benchmark 2030 instrument at 8.765%.
