South African clothing retailers have been hit as a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and job losses constrain discretionary spending. However, Pepkor, majority-owned by Steinhoff, is faring better than others with its focus on budget-conscious consumers, including more than 17 million South Africans on welfare and special Covid-19 grants. The retailer, which vies with TFGâ€™s Jet clothing chain, said revenues at its clothing and general merchandise division rose by 8%, with the Pep and Ackermans clothing brands reporting sales growth of 8.9%, or 6.3% on a like-for-like basis. The furniture, appliances and electronics division, which includes the JD Group, Incredible Connection and Hi-Fi Corporation brands, reported revenue growth of 7.5%, driven by technology upgrades and work and school from home trends, while revenues at its fintech division rose 5.8%. Net debt at December 31, including discontinued operations, fell to R5.6 billion from the R7.1 billion reported on September30. Pepkor said the delayed start to the school year is expected to shift some January sales into February, while volatile trading patterns are expected during the second quarter due to Covid-19 restrictions.
