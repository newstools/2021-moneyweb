The state-run company that supplies almost all of South Africa’s power has instituted intermittent power outages across major cities since 2008 because it can’t supply the electricity the country needs. Last year was the worst on record for power cuts in the country. While a replacement of the steam generators is planned, that will take time and efforts will be made to repair the faulty equipment, Ntuli said in an interview. “We are not yet done with preparation” for the outage, he said. “It will have a bit of an impact.”
