Spur’s total sales fell to R2.9 billion ($192 million) for the six months ended December 31 from R4.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. Sales from franchised restaurants declined by 31% in South Africa and by 17.3% in international restaurants in rand terms, the owner of the RocoMamas burger chain and Spur Steak Ranches said. In December the South African government re-imposed some lockdown restrictions such as the ban on alcohol sales, longer night curfew hours and the closure of beaches. This impacted Spur’s December sales, which declined by 25.8% in South Africa compared with a year earlier.
