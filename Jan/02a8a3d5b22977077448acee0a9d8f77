But renewed attention to roomier pants may finally provide more variety on denim shelves. Levi reported fourth-quarter sales that came in above analysts’ estimates, but the company said the pandemic is still clouding its outlook. Shares fell 6.8% in after-market trading Wednesday afternoon. The denim label started selling a baggier line of jeans this past season in both men’s and women’s, and it’s off to a fast start, the CEO said. The loose-straight fit, much less snug than the skinny, has also performed well, especially in recent months. Executives have also made it a focus to sell a broader array of products, such as sweats and chinos. They aim to have half of revenue come from non-denim pants over the next decade.
