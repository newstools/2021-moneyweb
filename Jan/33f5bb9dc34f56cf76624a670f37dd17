Prescribed minimum benefits (PMB) are a list of minimum benefits that all medical schemes must provide to members, irrespective of what benefit option they belong to. By introducing a list of PMBs in 2000, the Council for Medical Schemes aimed to provide people with continuous care to improve their health and well-being. Healthcare is made more affordable when membersÂ have adequate cover and, in the event of a serious illness or major risk event, they do not run out of medical aid cover or lose benefits, forcing them to go to state hospitals for treatment.

Your healthcare consultant can help you understand what treatment you are entitled to have covered when it comes to your condition. All medical schemes must cover PMBs in full as regulated by the Council of Medical Schemes. However, in order to contain the cost of providing this benefit, medical schemes may put measures in place to ensure you have the cover you need, without placing the scheme at financial risk: Medical schemes are allowed to impose important interventions and restrictions: Schemes have to include these arrangements in their rules and if you do not abide by these, you face having to pay all or part of the cost of the treatment yourself. It is important that you always check your benefits Speak to your healthcare advisor or consultant if your hospitalisation, treatment or chronic condition medication, or test falls within the scope of a PMB but has not been funded correctly or from the correct benefit, such as from your savings account instead of the risk benefit.
