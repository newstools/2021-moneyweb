Zoom has gained more than 380% in the past 12 months, reflecting the demand it has seen as people work, learn and socialise on their computers. The stock has become a barometer of the pandemic economy, rising when Covid-19 lockdowns emerge and falling on good news about vaccines.

In Zoom’s latest earnings report, it suggested that revenue growth in 2021 may be slightly less explosive than it was last year. Still, Zoom said it expects an increase in sales of 330% in the current quarter, which ends in January. © 2021 Bloomberg
