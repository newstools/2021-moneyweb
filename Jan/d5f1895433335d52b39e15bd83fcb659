KwaZulu-Natal, which now accounts for 20.7% (264 532) of cases since the outbreak, has surpassed the Western Cape (19.4% or 248 339 cases). KwaZulu-Natal is also the current epicentre of the virus in SA, with a surge in new infections and the highest number of active Covid-19 cases (69 559) at present among the provinces.

The number of excess natural deaths in the week of December 30, 2020 to January 5, 2021 reached a record high of 3 389, more than double the peak of the first wave of 1 306 deaths,” the report says. “Deaths from natural causes have increased rapidly in Gauteng in the past three weeks, with 1 725 excess deaths during the week of New Year. Similar upticks have been experienced in the City of Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and the City of Tshwane, each with an excess of about 500 deaths,” it adds.
