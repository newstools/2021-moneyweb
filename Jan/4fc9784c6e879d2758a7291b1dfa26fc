Africa’s largest coal export facility said 92% of its exports went to Asia last year, with India and Pakistan being the largest takers. Waller said the company had, however, exported about 654 000 tonnes of coal to China in 2020, the first time it has sent exports there since 2014. Waller said RBCT was hopeful of further exports to China in 2021. China’s coal imports from Australia plunged in December as it targeted various Australian products with unofficial import restrictions. Relations between Beijing and Canberra have come under increasing strain amid a series of disputes over trade, politics and the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.
