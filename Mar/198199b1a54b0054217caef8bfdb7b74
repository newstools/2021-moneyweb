South African state-owned defence company Denel has appointed Thandeka Sabela as acting Chief Financial Officer, the firm said on Tuesday. The firmâ€™s former CFO, Carmen le Grange, resigned earlier in March, extending a series of exits including the board chair and chief executive, deepening a crisis at the cash-strapped firm. Sabela, a chartered accountant, has been with Denel since 2015. She will take-up the position on March 29. The process of recruiting a new, permanent finance chief is underway.
