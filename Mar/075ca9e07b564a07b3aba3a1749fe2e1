The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and related lockdowns has forced Nedbank to revise its medium-term targets. The bank is the first in the country to provide updated targets. Chief executive Mike Brown says the bank has revised its targets “so that they reflect the current environment”.

It notes that the “Nedbank Economic Unit forecasts GDP growth of 3.4% for 2021, which is a material improvement from the 7% contraction in 2020, but real GDP is expected to return to 2019 levels only in the latter part of 2023″. The bank also highlights that “banks are highly integrated in the economies where they operate”. Therefore, given that GDP is only forecast to get back to 2019 levels by “late 2023/early 2024”, it makes sense to use 2019 as the base. By 2023, Brown says the bank aims to “exceed our 2019 diluted Heps [headline earnings per share] level of 2 565 cents, achieve an ROE [return on equity] greater than the 2019 ROE level of 15%, reduce our cost-to-income ratio to below 54%, and rank number one on the NPS [Net Promoter Score] among SA banks”. The group reported a 57% decline in diluted Heps of 1 113c for 2020. It expects growth of more than 20% in 2021 at this stage, but cannot yet quantify the expected range. The consensus forecast for the sector (from Iress) is that total headline earnings for 2022 will exceed those from 2019. This suggests that Nedbank should comfortably get to its target by 2023. It says this is “supported” by the credit loss ratio “getting back into the through the cycle range of 60 to 100 bps [basis points]”. It reported a credit loss ratio of 161 bps (1.61%) for 2020 and expects this to be “between 110 bps to 130 bps” in 2021. Growth To get to its long-term earnings growth target of greater than inflation (CPI) plus GDP growth plus 5% will require it to become significantly more efficient (its cost-to-income needs to be closer to 50%) as well as broader constraints on economic growth to be removed. It adjusted this down to its prior target of “around consumer price index + GDP growth” a number of years ago. The ROE target of 15% by 2023 is lower than its previous medium-term target of more than 17%. The group notes the “cost of equity is currently forecast at around 14.4% in 2021 to 2023”. Over the long-term, it expects ROE of above 18%, which would be close to 400 basis points higher than the cost of equity. Cost-to-income challenges The bank continues to struggle to get its cost-to-income ratio down. Its most recent medium-term target on this front was to get it to “equal to or below 53%” by 2020. Impacting this is its share of associate income from ETI (Ecobank Transnational Incorporated), which tends to be erratic at best. At the release of its 2018 results (in early 2019), it cautioned that while it remained “committed” to its group “target of ≤ 53% by 2020 … it has become more challenging to achieve”. In 2018, it reported a cost-to-income ratio of 57.2%. In 2020, this number was 56.5%. Key to getting its stubbornly-high cost-to-income ratio down has been the Retail and Business Banking unit, where the long-term intent was to get the ratio to equal to or below 58%. In early 2019, it also warned that this remained its target for 2020, but that it has “become more difficult to achieve”. Critical factors The revised medium-term target announced on Wednesday is “less than 54%” by 2023. It says “delivering on Strategic Portfolio Tilt 2.0 (SPT) and Target Operating Model 2.0 (TOM) initiative” is critical to achieving this. It aims for cumulative benefits of R2.5 billion over three years. It continues to reduce targeted expenses in the business. Group employees are 4% lower than 2019 (and 9% lower than in 2018). Overall, expenses declined by 1% in the year. Staff costs were up by 2% in 2020. Source: Nedbank 2020 annual results The group reported a 56.5% drop in headline earnings for the year (to R5.4 billion), compared to a decline of 69.2% in the first-half of last year. Revenue was down 3.5% to R54.2 billion. Its return on equity for the year was 6.2%. The credit loss ratio for the year was 161 bps (versus 79 bps a year prior). It declared no dividend for the year but said it intended to resume dividends in the first half of 2021. Payment relief The group says to “support clients in good standing, the group provided … payment relief on a total of more than R120 billion of client loans across the portfolio, representing 15% of total loans and advances”. “At 31 December 2020, this had declined to R28 billion as payment holidays matured and clients resumed payment plans.” In the Retail and Business Banking unit, these payment relief loans declined “from a peak of R80 billion to R2 billion at the end of December, with 88% of clients who had any form of payment relief having resumed payment, 9% having missed payments and 3% having payment relief either extended or having not yet matured”. “The remaining outstanding D3/2020 [payment relief] loans include R25 billion for clients in CIB [corporate and investment bank] and the majority of these are expected to mature in H1 2021”.
