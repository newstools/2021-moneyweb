Eskom will cancel scheduled power cuts from midday local time (1000 GMT), its spokesman said on Friday. Eskom added in a statement that it had returned generation units to service at its Duvha, Medupi, Kendal, Kriel and Kusile power stations. “The improved generation availability, together with the lower long weekend demand, has enabled us to cancel load-shedding,” the statement said, using a local term for scheduled outages.
