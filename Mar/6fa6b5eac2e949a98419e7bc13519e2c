South Africa started administering coronavirus vaccines on February 17, with health-care workers receiving the first single-shot doses developed by Johnson & Johnson. The government aims to inoculate two-thirds of the population by year-end and says it’s secured enough vaccines to meet that goal. The support will help take pressure off a government trying to contain spending after a surge in debt and an economic contraction because of lockdowns to contain the pandemic. The National Treasury has set aside R10.3 billion for vaccines for the next three years, with another R9 billion available in an emergency fund. The Solidarity Fund is in talks with the health ministry and other parties to identify what else can be done to accelerate the rollout of vaccines, Nzimande said. © 2021 Bloomberg
