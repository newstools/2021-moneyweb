The administrators said they had received R7.8 billion out of a R10.5 billion bailout allocated in the government’s October mid-term budget. Out of that, around R360 million has gone towards paying unpaid salaries, R1.5 billion has been spent on severance packages and R400 million has been transferred to creditors who lent money after the airline entered administration. Other funds are earmarked for working capital when SAA restarts operations and to pay for passengers who have already paid for tickets but not yet flown. Once further payments to creditors and employees have been made or provided for and a receivership set up, the administrators can relinquish control of the business. The administrators said SAA’s debt had fallen by 35.7 billion rand since they took over and that its workforce had been cut from 4 700 to roughly 1 000.
