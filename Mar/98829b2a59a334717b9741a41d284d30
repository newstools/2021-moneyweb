The decision threatens to derail the sale of more than R8 billion ($516 million) of broadband spectrum following years of delays, a move designed to help revive the economy and lower data costs. The auction has long been demanded by mobile-phone operators including Telkom, but the former phone monopoly took action after concluding the terms are not to the company’s benefit.
