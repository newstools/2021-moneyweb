The authors analysed cases and tests carried out across all 55 African Union member states between Feb. 14, 2020 and Dec. 31, when more than half of these countries had or were experiencing a resurgence of infections. While notable variants only emerged near the end of that period, they are likely to have at least partly driven the surge, they said.
