The French navy seized six tons of cocaine on a ship traveling from South America in the largest drug seizure off the West African coast this year. The narcotic was discovered when the French vessel intercepted a Saint Kitts and Nevis-flagged cargo ship in the Gulf of Guinea, the French Justice Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. France’s anti-drug agency, Europol and Brazilian authorities collaborated in the seizure, which is the second-largest in the region since authorities in Cape Verde found 9.6 tons of cocaine on a Panama-flagged vessel in 2019. © 2021 Bloomberg Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.
