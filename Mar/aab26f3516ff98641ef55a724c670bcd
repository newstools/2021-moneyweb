South Africa has opened up a telecommunications contract to supply 1.2 million government employees, allowing arch rivals MTN and Vodacom to share in the state business. MTN was added to the agreement previously awarded exclusively to Vodacom in 2016, according to a statement on Tuesday. The deal was worth R5 billion when first agreed upon, people familiar with the matter said at the time. The move helps to level the playing field in South Africa by sharing around one of the largest contracts available in Africa’s most industrialised economy. Vodacom is the country’s market leader with about 44 million customers, compared with MTN’s 29 million. © 2021 Bloomberg Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.
