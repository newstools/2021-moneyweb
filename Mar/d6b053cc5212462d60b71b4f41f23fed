David Hufton, who currently shares the role with her, will assume the role of sole CEO on June 1, 2021. The group said Wierzycka had led Sygnia since its inception in 2006 and would “continue to play a key role in shaping the strategic direction of the company together with its executive team and the board of directors.” Wierzycka and her associates will retain their majority shareholding in the company. Hufton was appointed as Deputy CEO of the company in July 2018 and as a joint CEO in April 2020. The board thanked Wierzycka for her dedication and devotion to the company she co-founded in 2006, and is confident that Hufton and the current management team is well-positioned to steer Sygnia into its next chapter. In the last few years, Wierzycka has been an outspoken critic of “state capture.”
