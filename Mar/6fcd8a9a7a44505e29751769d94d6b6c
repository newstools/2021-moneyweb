The country kicked off its vaccination campaign last month with J&J’s single-dose vaccine after suspending plans to administer AstraZeneca’s double-dose vaccine. A small trial showed the AstraZeneca shot offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the dominant local coronavirus variant. The J&J shot is being given to up to 500 000 healthcare workers in a research study to further evaluate it in the field before a larger-scale rollout is expected to start in the second quarter. Local pharmaceutical company Aspen will be manufacturing J&J doses under licence. Mkhize added in his written reply that the J&J vaccine was cost-effective for reasons including that it is effective against the 501Y.V2 variant first identified in South Africa late last year, it is stored at fridge temperature and it is a single-dose vaccine.
